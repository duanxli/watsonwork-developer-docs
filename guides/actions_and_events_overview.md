# Actions and Events

Watson Work Services gives your App two patterns for dealing with events in the system and allowing for actions from a client. Your App can listen to events through secure web hooks. Also, your App can handle actions that might be invoked from a Watson Work Services client so that you can provide an experience to users for taking that action by using entered Commands.
