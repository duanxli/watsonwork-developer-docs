# Actions and Events

Watson Work Services gives your App two patterns for dealing with events in the system and allowing for actions from a client. Your App can listen to events through secure web hooks. Also, your App can handle actions that might be invoked from a Watson Work Services client so that you can provide an experience to users for taking that action by using Client Action Handlers or using Commands.

## Listen to Events

Refer to [Listen to Events](../guides/V1_wwsg_Webhooks.md) for details. 

## Handling Client Actions 
Watson Work Services allows your App to provide for actions issued from a Watson Work 
Services client (for example, Watson Workspace). Refer to [Handling Client Actions](../guides/handling_client_actions.md) for details.
