## Handling Client Actions

Watson Work Services allows your App to provide for actions issued from a Watson Work Services client (for example, Watson Workspace). Here your App will be invoked directly from the client app and can provide a user experience to guide a user through the fulfillment of that action. This is accomplished by using Client Action Handlers.

### Client Action Handlers

Client Action Handlers allow your App to deliver a user experience to a Watson Work Services 
client. You will need to register a call back URL that the client can invoke for specified actions 
so that the client can recognize and enable your action for users. Once a user invokes your 
action through the client, your App can access context. 

Hereâ€™s the flow for client action handlers:

Currently you can register a Client Action Handler to deal with configuration of your App, and 
this supports two configuration use cases. For a user in a space, your App can provide 
configuration called "space configuration". Also, your app can provide configuration for a 
team, so that a team administrator can set the appropriate configuration for your app for their 
entire team, called "team configuration". 

Steps to add an action handler:
1. Go to Your Apps and choose an App.
2. Click Add an Action. 
3. Click Add an action handler.
4. Type the action handler URL.
5. Select the team-app-config-requested checkbox if you want to enable the team configuration. Select space-app-config-requested checkbox if you want to enable the space configuration.

### Space Configuration 

Invididual users including team members, space owners, and sapce users can configure the Apps based on their preferences. For example, a scheduling app might need calendar access. Having the user's authorization or credentials is essential for coordinating with third-party services.  

Recognizing user-specific preferences can also enhance your App. For example, the scheduling app can propose better meeting times when user has already entered their preferred times.

If your App enables space configuration, users in a space will see a Configure button.

### Team Configuration 
The team administrators manage the app configuration for the entire team and the configuration can improve the enablment of your App. For example, for a file managment App, the team administraotr can configure the source url of the file service and the the authentication method required.

If your App enables team configuration, team administrators will see a Configure button in App details page from the administration portal. Only the team administrators have access to configure an App for the entire team.
